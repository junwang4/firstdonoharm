### Purposes
Learn sorting and advanced sorting (by proxy value)

### Homework

For table `ingredient_other_names.csv`, create a new feature, called `top_k_word_cnt`,
that are the top 5 most frequently used words in the other names.
For the example, in the case of ingredient `baobab`, the `top_k_word_cnt` should be:
```
{'baobab': 25, 'de': 9, 'adansonia': 7, 'tree': 6, 'fruit': 4}
```


For table `ingredient_side_effects.csv`,
create a new feature, called `top_k_word_cnt`, that are the top 30 most frequently used words in the side-effects.

Regular Expressions will be used a lot in our future lessons.
It involves quite some math thinking.
