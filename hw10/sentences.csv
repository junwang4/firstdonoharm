dmso-dimethylsulfoxide_3_2,I got some 15 years ago because I had pain from congenital spinal degeneration and of course an increase in severe  back pain.
dmso-dimethylsulfoxide_3_3,"To me, it didn't really work for that (difficult to apply)."
dmso-dimethylsulfoxide_3_4,"But now I have severe arthritic joint pain too and it definitely works for that, for me."
dmso-dimethylsulfoxide_3_5,"For the back, one thing that really worked and got me mobile was acupuncture."

dmso-dimethylsulfoxide_4_16,What I can't understand is why so many people comment positively on DMSO here on WebMD.
dmso-dimethylsulfoxide_4_17,No one has anything to gain from promoting this product.
dmso-dimethylsulfoxide_4_18,No one can make much money on this since it is only an industrial solvent.
dmso-dimethylsulfoxide_4_19,I have read many unbelievable stories about this and watched the 60 Minutes segment on YouTube.
dmso-dimethylsulfoxide_4_21,"Since no one can make any money on this, there is not money to do controlled clinical trials."

vitamin-k_1_10,"Would recommend Boron supplements according to dosage recommendations, or perhaps Potassium Gluconate as they take far longer to fill out the basic requirement."
