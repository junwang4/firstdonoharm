This research is concerning, but it is still too soon to say for certain that calcium is truly the cause of heart attack. Until more is known, continue consuming adequate amounts of calcium to meet daily requirements, but not excessive amounts of calcium. Be sure to consider total calcium intake from both dietary and supplemental sources and try not to exceed 1000-1300 mg of calcium per day.

Fig FRUIT is unlikely to cause sun sensitivity.    Skin contact with fig fruit or leaves can cause  rash  in sensitive people.     "
figwort,There isn't enough information to know if figwort is safe.  
fir,Fir might be safe for most people. The potential side effects of fir are not known.  
fireweed,Fireweed seems to be safe for most adults.  
fish-oil,"Fish oil is  LIKELY SAFE  for most people when taken by mouth in low doses (3 grams or less per day). There are some safety concerns when fish oil is taken in high doses. Taking more than 3 grams per day might keep blood from clotting and can increase the chance of bleeding.    

High doses of fish oil might also reduce the immune system's activity, reducing the body's ability to fight infection. This is a special concern for people taking medications to reduce their immune system's activity (organ transplant patients, for example) and the elderly.    

Only take high doses of fish oil while under medical supervision.    

Fish oil can cause side effects including belching, bad breath, heartburn, nausea, loose stools, rash, and nosebleeds. Taking fish oil supplements with meals or freezing them can often decrease these side effects.    
Fish oil is  POSSIBLY SAFE  when injected intravenously (by IV) in the short-term. Fish oil or omega-3 fatty acid solutions have been safely used for 1 to 4 weeks.    

Consuming large amounts of fish oil from some DIETARY sources is  POSSIBLY UNSAFE . Some fish meats (especially shark, king mackerel, and farm-raised salmon) can be contaminated with mercury and other industrial and environmental chemicals. Fish oil supplements typically do not contain these contaminants.
 "
flaxseed,"Flaxseed is  LIKELY SAFE  for most adults when taken by mouth. Adding flaxseed to the diet might increase the number of bowel movements each day. It might also cause gastrointestinal (GI) side effects such as bloating, gas, abdominal pain, constipation, diarrhea, stomachache, and nausea. Higher doses are likely to cause more GI side effects.    There is some concern that taking large amounts of flaxseed could block the intestines due to the bulk-forming laxative effects of flaxseed. Flaxseed should be taken with plenty of water to prevent this from happening.    Taking flaxseed extracts that contain lignans in concentrated form is  POSSIBLY SAFE . Lignans are the chemicals in flaxseed that are thought to be responsible for many of the effects. Some clinical research shows that a specific flaxseed lignan extract (Flax Essence, Jarrow Formulas) can be safely used for up to 12 weeks.    Products that contain partially defatted flaxseed, which is flaxseed with less alpha-linolenic acid content, are available. Some men choose these products because they have heard that alpha-linolenic acid might raise their risk of getting prostate cancer. It’s important to remember that the source of the alpha-linolenic acid is key. Alpha-linolenic acid from dairy and meat sources has been positively associated with prostate cancer. However, alpha-linolenic acid from plant sources, such as flaxseed, does not seem to affect prostate cancer risk. Men should not worry about getting alpha-linoleic acid from flaxseed. On the other hand, there is a concern that partially defatted flaxseed might raise triglyceride levels too much. Triglycerides are a type of blood fat.    Raw or unripe flaxseed is  POSSIBLY UNSAFE . Flaxseed in these forms is thought to be poisonous.     "
flaxseed-oil,"Flaxseed oil is  LIKELY SAFE  for most adults when taken by mouth appropriately short-term.    Large doses of 30 grams per day and higher can cause loose stools and diarrhea. Allergic reactions have occurred while taking flaxseed oil.    Some men worry that taking flaxseed oil might increase their chance of getting prostate cancer because of the alpha-linolenic acid that flaxseed oil contains. Researchers are still trying to figure out the role of alpha-linolenic acid in prostate cancer. Some studies suggest that alpha-linolenic acid may increase risk or make existing prostate cancer worse, but other studies find no connection. Nevertheless, the alpha-linolenic acid in flaxseed oil does not seem to be a problem. Alpha-linolenic acid from plant sources, such as flaxseed, does not seem to affect prostate cancer risk, although alpha-linolenic acid from dairy and meat sources has been linked in some studies with prostate cancer.    Not enough is known about the safety of flaxseed oil when it is applied to the skin.      "
fluoride,"Fluoride is safe for most people in the amounts added to public water supplies and used in toothpastes and mouthwashes, and applied by dentists. Low doses (up to 20 mg per day of elemental fluoride) of supplemental fluoride taken by  mouth  appear to be safe for most people. Higher doses are  UNSAFE  and can weaken bones and ligaments, and cause muscle  weakness  and  nervous system  problems. High doses of fluoride in children before their permanent teeth come through the gums can cause  tooth discoloration .    Toothpaste and fluoride rinses should not be swallowed routinely, particularly by children. It’s a good idea to make sure that children under six years of age use only a pea-sized amount of fluoride-containing toothpaste, just in case they swallow some.  "
folic-acid,"Folic acid is  LIKELY SAFE  for most people when taken by mouth or injected into the body. Most adults do not experience any side effects when used in doses less than 1000 mcg daily.

High doses of folic acid might cause abdominal cramps, diarrhea, rash, sleep disorders, irritability, confusion, nausea, stomach upset, behavior changes, skin reactions, seizures, gas, excitability, and other side effects.    There is some concern that taking too much folic acid for a long period of time might cause serious side effects. Some research suggests that taking folic acid in doses of 800-1200 mcg might increase the risk of heart attack in people who have heart problems. Other research suggests that taking these high doses might also increase the risk of cancer such as lung or prostate cancer.     "
fools-parsley,"Fool's parsley is  UNSAFE . Avoid using it. It might cause serious, possibly life-threatening poisonings.    Fool's parsley got its name because it looks a lot like young garden parsley. Be careful not to confuse the two, since fool's parsley is poisonous.  "

These serious side effects include the inability to control the bowels,  vomiting , mental changes, sedation, agitation, combativeness,  memory loss , serious breathing and  heart  problems,  fainting ,  seizures ,  coma , and death. The effects can be made worse by alcohol or narcotics such as  morphine ,  heroin , and others. Long-term use may lead to withdrawal symptoms including  insomnia , tremor, and  anxiety .  "
